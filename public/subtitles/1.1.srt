00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,120
Today we're going to be taking a deep


00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,740
dive into cybersecurity, something super important for, well,


00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,560
any business really, but we're going to be


00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,820
focusing on small and medium enterprises today.


00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,060
Right.


00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,860
And, you know, you sent in this training


00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,460
module called Cybersecurity for SME Employees, Module 1


00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,000
.1 Introduction to Cybersecurity, and we're going to


00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,960
be digging into that today.


00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,580
Yeah, it's a great module.


00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,860
So let's get right into it.


00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,360
Sounds good.


00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,180
I'm really curious.


00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,900
You know, this document really stresses that cybersecurity

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,340
is essential these days.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,660
Why is that?

18
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,680
And is it really that big a deal,

19
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,740
especially for smaller businesses?

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,300
You know, sometimes you think, oh, that's not

21
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,960
going to happen to me.

22
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,540
I'm too small.

23
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,020
You know, that's a common misconception, right?

24
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,620
And I think historically that that may have

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,020
been true to an extent, but, you know,

26
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,820
cybercriminals, they used to target large corporations because

27
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,120
that's where the big payoff was, right?

28
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,640
But these days, they're realizing that SMEs are

29
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,220
actually a much softer target.

30
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,500
Oh, yeah.

31
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,360
Why is that?

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,940
Well, SMEs often have fewer resources dedicated to

33
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,560
security, right?

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
So their defenses are often weaker and, you

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,460
know, they're seen as, you know, kind of

36
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,240
easier picking.

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
And I feel like a lot of small

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,860
businesses, they almost feel like they're flying under

39
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,300
the radar.

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,020
You know?

41
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,480
You're right.

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:14,900
Exactly.

43
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,660
Like, oh, who would want to target me?

44
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Exactly.

45
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,020
Yeah.

46
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,620
They have that false sense of security.

47
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:19,900
Right.

48
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,140
But the reality is that, you know, the

49
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,700
impact of a cyberattack on an SME can

50
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,880
be absolutely devastating.

51
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,700
Oh, for sure.

52
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,620
And one statistic that I always find really,

53
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,840
really alarming is that 60% of SMEs

54
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,040
that suffer a major cyberattack go out of

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,280
business within six months.

56
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,960
60%?

57
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,960
60%, yeah.

58
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,880
That's a really scary thought.

59
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,420
It is.

60
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,420
It's incredibly sobering.

61
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah.

62
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,240
So it's definitely something that we can't just

63
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,820
brush aside.

64
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,680
Not at all.

65
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,180
Not at all.

66
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,280
Yeah.

67
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,580
So let's break it down a little bit.

68
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:49,840
Sure.

69
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,220
You know, this document defines cybersecurity as protecting

70
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,280
systems, networks, and data from attacks.

71
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,980
So what does that actually look like in

72
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,360
practice?

73
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,320
So in practice, it's really about putting safeguards

74
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,380
in place to protect those assets.

75
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,280
Okay.

76
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:07,740
Right.

77
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,000
And when we say assets, we're talking about,

78
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,140
you know, your computer systems, obviously, the data

79
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,680
that you store, your network connections.

80
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,020
Right.

81
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,640
All of those things are valuable assets that

82
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,240
need to be protected from theft, from damage,

83
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,360
and from disruption.

84
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
So are we talking about like an actual

85
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
physical attack?

86
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,240
Not necessarily, no.

87
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,240
Or are we talking about like, I always

88
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,380
think of it as like a hacker in

89
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,640
a dark room, you know?

90
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,380
Right, right.

91
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
On a computer, like that kind of thing.

92
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah.

93
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,100
Well, there is definitely that element to it,

94
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,340
right?

95
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,600
You know, hackers trying to break into your

96
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,080
network, steal customer data, things like that.

97
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,360
Yeah.

98
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,100
But it can also be much more insidious,

99
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,460
right?

100
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,140
It can be things like phishing emails that

101
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,880
look completely legitimate, but are actually designed to

102
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,900
trick employees into revealing their passwords or other

103
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,880
sensitive information.

104
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,360
Got it.

105
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,680
So it really runs the gamut, from very

106
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,260
sophisticated technical attacks to very, you know, low

107
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,920
-tech social engineering tactics.

108
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,500
So it sounds like it's a pretty broad

109
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,400
umbrella term then.

110
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,880
It is.

111
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,440
It is.

112
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,660
Okay.

113
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:09,760
Okay.

114
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, the document also mentions these three core

115
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,060
objectives of cybersecurity.

116
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,340
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

117
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:17,980
Right.

118
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
So can you break those down for us

119
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,440
a little bit?

120
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,760
Sure.

121
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,480
So confidentiality is all about keeping sensitive information

122
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,060
private.

123
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay.

124
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:24,960
Right?

125
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,360
So that could be your company's trade secrets,

126
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
it could be your customer's financial data, you

127
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,580
know?

128
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:31,980
Yeah.

129
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,340
Anything that's really important and needs to be

130
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,000
kept under wraps.

131
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,680
So it's kind of like the Fort Knox

132
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,260
of information.

133
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,180
Yeah, exactly.

134
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay.

135
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,120
Got it.

136
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,080
And then integrity is all about ensuring that

137
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,780
your data is accurate and that it hasn't

138
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,600
been tampered with.

139
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:44,980
Okay.

140
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,380
Right?

141
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,180
So imagine if someone were to maliciously alter

142
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,340
your financial records or change the specifications for

143
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,700
a product that you're manufacturing.

144
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,020
Right.

145
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,740
I mean, that could have disastrous consequences.

146
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,580
That would be bad.

147
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:57,920
Yeah.

148
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,120
So it's really about protecting the accuracy and

149
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,680
the trustworthiness of your data.

150
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,740
Got it.

151
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,540
And then finally, availability is about making sure

152
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,100
that your systems and your data are accessible

153
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,240
when you need them.

154
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,140
Okay.

155
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,840
So, you know, think about what would happen

156
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,600
if your website went down or if your

157
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,339
employees couldn't access their email.

158
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,820
Oh.

159
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,640
It would bring your business to a screeching

160
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,040
halt.

161
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,440
Right?

162
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah.

163
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,580
So availability is about ensuring that your systems

164
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,020
are up and running and that you can

165
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,740
access your data when you need it.

166
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,260
Got it.

167
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay.

168
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,980
So it's kind of like making sure that

169
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,740
the lights stay on in the digital world.

170
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,360
Exactly.

171
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:33,800
Exactly.

172
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
And that everything's running smoothly.

173
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah.

174
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,640
Okay.

175
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,140
And all three of these objectives are interconnected.

176
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,100
Right.

177
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,360
So a breach in confidentiality could affect data

178
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,960
integrity, and an attack that impacts availability can

179
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,900
also compromise confidentiality.

180
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
It's like a domino effect.

181
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,500
Exactly.

182
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:49,920
Yeah.

183
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,340
So it's really important to have a holistic

184
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,920
approach to cyber security where you're addressing all

185
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
three of these objectives.

186
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,820
Okay.

187
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,380
Well, the document also dives into the key

188
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,280
components of cyber security, and it lists network

189
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,780
security, information security, endpoint security, application security, cloud

190
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,220
security, and then user awareness training.

191
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,040
That seems like a lot.

192
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,560
It is.

193
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,420
It's a lot to unpack.

194
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:14,780
Yeah.

195
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,720
But they all play a crucial role in

196
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,340
building that strong cyber security posture.

197
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,260
Got it.

198
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,840
But maybe just to kind of keep things

199
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,120
manageable, let's just focus on one for right

200
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,340
now.

201
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,620
Okay.

202
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Which one do you want to focus on?

203
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,140
Let's talk about endpoint security.

204
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay.

205
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,580
Because I think it's a great example of

206
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,140
how a seemingly small vulnerability can have really

207
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,120
major consequences.

208
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,800
Okay.

209
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,360
I'm all ears.

210
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:38,840
All right.

211
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,960
So endpoints.

212
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,700
What are endpoints?

213
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,560
Endpoints are essentially any device that connects to

214
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,120
your network.

215
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,460
Okay.

216
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,540
So think laptops, smartphones, tablets.

217
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,300
Maybe my printer.

218
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,100
Even your printer.

219
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,340
Yeah.

220
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,840
Anything that connects to the network is a

221
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,960
potential entry point for a cyber criminal.

222
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,540
So even if I have really good network

223
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,340
security, you're saying that if one of my

224
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,120
employees' laptops is compromised, that could potentially take

225
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,860
down the whole system.

226
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,120
That's exactly right.

227
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,940
Oh, wow.

228
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,280
Yeah.

229
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,060
And unfortunately, SMEs often overlook endpoint security.

230
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,120
Do they?

231
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,600
They do.

232
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,060
They do.

233
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,620
Why is that?

234
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,540
Well, I think there's a tendency to focus

235
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,740
more on protecting the network as a whole,

236
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,100
right?

237
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,420
Right.

238
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,640
Which is important, of course.

239
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,240
Yeah.

240
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,760
But it's kind of like having a fortress

241
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,600
with a back door wide open.

242
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:24,900
Okay.

243
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,240
Yeah.

244
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,340
No, that makes a lot of sense.

245
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,680
Right.

246
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,960
So it's really important to not neglect endpoint

247
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,520
security.

248
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,280
Okay.

249
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,140
So what are some of the vulnerabilities then

250
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,380
when it comes to endpoint security?

251
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,960
Well, one major vulnerability is outdated software.

252
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,360
Okay.

253
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:39,840
Right?

254
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,300
So software updates often include security patches that

255
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,460
fix known weaknesses.

256
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,500
And if you don't update your software regularly,

257
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,400
you're essentially leaving the door open for hackers

258
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,020
to exploit those weaknesses.

259
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,040
So those pesky little update reminders, they're actually

260
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
doing us a favor.

261
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,400
They are.

262
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,260
They are.

263
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,900
Think of them as free security upgrades.

264
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,260
Okay.

265
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:00,700
Right.

266
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,200
Makes sense.

267
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,140
Another common vulnerability is weak passwords.

268
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,260
Ah, yes.

269
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Right?

270
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,600
If an employee uses a simple, easily guessed

271
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,380
password on their laptop, and that laptop gets

272
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,480
compromised, well, hackers can potentially gain access to

273
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,220
sensitive company data.

274
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,280
So using password 123, probably not a good

275
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,560
idea.

276
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,800
Probably not the best idea, no.

277
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Okay.

278
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,740
It sounds like it's really important for employees

279
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,980
to be aware of these risks and to

280
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,440
follow security best practices.

281
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,340
Absolutely.

282
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,700
Yeah.

283
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,980
And that's something that we'll definitely delve into

284
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,320
more as we go along.

285
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,160
But I am curious about these other key

286
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,280
components of cybersecurity.

287
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Can we talk a little bit more about

288
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,820
those?

289
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,460
Yeah, absolutely.

290
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,620
So let's move on to network security, which,

291
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,900
as the name suggests, focuses on protecting your

292
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,360
entire network infrastructure from unauthorized access and attacks.

293
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:50,960
Okay.

294
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,900
So think firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure Wi

295
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,800
-Fi configurations.

296
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
These are all part of network security.

297
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
So it's kind of like building a strong

298
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,040
wall around your network.

299
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,600
Exactly.

300
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:01,940
Yeah.

301
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,780
It's like building the walls and the moats

302
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,840
of your digital fortress.

303
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,260
Got it.

304
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:05,720
Right.

305
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,660
Keeping those unwanted visitors out.

306
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,040
Okay.

307
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,560
So then what about information security?

308
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,160
So information security is a bit broader.

309
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,780
Okay.

310
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,340
It encompasses all the policies and procedures that

311
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,040
you have in place to protect sensitive data.

312
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay.

313
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,080
Both digital and physical.

314
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,320
So this includes things like access control, data

315
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,340
encryption, data backup, and recovery.

316
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:28,960
Okay.

317
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,039
Even secure document disposal.

318
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,799
Oh, wow.

319
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,419
So it's like a whole life cycle of

320
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:33,940
security.

321
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,460
It is.

322
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,000
It is.

323
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,720
It's about managing and protecting data throughout its

324
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,700
entire life cycle.

325
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,320
Got it.

326
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,659
Right.

327
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,600
From the moment it's created to the moment

328
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,280
it's destroyed.

329
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,700
Okay.

330
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,240
Makes sense.

331
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Then what about application security?

332
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,260
So application security focuses on securing the software

333
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,340
applications that your business relies on.

334
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,160
Right.

335
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,840
So this can involve things like secure coding

336
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,460
practices, vulnerability testing, regular security updates, and it's

337
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,860
really about preventing hackers from exploiting weaknesses in

338
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,820
the software itself.

339
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,600
So it's not just about protecting the devices.

340
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,360
It's also about protecting the software.

341
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,000
Exactly.

342
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,600
Yeah.

343
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,140
That makes sense.

344
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,420
Now what about cloud security?

345
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,620
So cloud security is becoming increasingly important as

346
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,920
more and more businesses are moving their operations

347
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,580
to the cloud.

348
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:20,820
Yeah.

349
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
Everyone's in the cloud now.

350
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,400
Right.

351
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,880
Exactly.

352
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,540
And cloud security involves securing the cloud platforms

353
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,900
and services that you use, as well as

354
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,620
the data that you store in the cloud.

355
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,200
So that's kind of its own separate beast

356
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,620
almost.

357
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,440
It is.

358
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:34,820
It is.

359
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:34,940
Okay.

360
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,300
It's a specialized area of cybersecurity.

361
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,980
Okay.

362
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,520
And then finally, we have user awareness training.

363
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,200
Okay.

364
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Which I think is absolutely crucial.

365
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,760
Why is that?

366
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Because even with the best technology in place,

367
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,660
human error remains one of the biggest security

368
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,140
risks.

369
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,780
Really?

370
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,480
Oh, yeah.

371
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,280
So people are still the weakest link?

372
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,840
In many cases, yes.

373
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,380
Okay.

374
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
You know, people can accidentally click on phishing

375
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,560
links.

376
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,140
They can use weak passwords.

377
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,960
They can fall victim to social engineering tactics.

378
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,580
Oh, we're sure.

379
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,740
So user awareness training is really about educating

380
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,540
employees about these threats and giving them the

381
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,300
tools that they need to protect themselves and

382
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,080
the organization.

383
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,280
So it's about empowering them to make good

384
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,680
decisions.

385
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,480
Exactly.

386
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,120
Exactly.

387
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,520
Okay.

388
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,360
So it sounds like it's not just about

389
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,720
having fancy technology.

390
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,100
No.

391
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,800
It's about having a holistic approach that involves

392
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,740
people, processes, and technology.

393
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,260
Absolutely.

394
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,780
Yeah.

395
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,220
It's about all of those things working together.

396
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,700
This has been really insightful so far.

397
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,060
We're just scratching the surface here.

398
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
There's a lot more to cover.

399
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,900
But we're going to continue to break down

400
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,400
these concepts and uncover more practical insights from

401
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
the source material in part two of this

402
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,820
deep dive.

403
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,720
Looking forward to it.

404
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
So stay tuned.

405
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,880
Yeah.

406
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,460
Join us.

407
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,520
And we'll be right back.

408
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,660
Okay.

409
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,580
So we've talked about all these different components

410
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,040
of cybersecurity, but I have to admit it's

411
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,440
a lot.

412
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,260
Yeah.

413
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,260
Where do we even start?

414
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,140
It's true.

415
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,560
It can be a little overwhelming, especially when

416
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,580
you're first starting out.

417
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,060
Yeah.

418
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,520
But the good news is you don't have

419
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,640
to become a cybersecurity expert overnight.

420
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,340
Okay.

421
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,820
That's good.

422
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,900
Just start with the basics and focus on

423
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,820
building good cybersecurity habits.

424
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,800
So like what kind of habits?

425
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,620
Well think of it like basic hygiene.

426
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,300
Right.

427
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,080
You wash your hands regularly to prevent the

428
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
spread of germs, right?

429
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,680
Right.

430
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,380
In cybersecurity, you practice good cyber hygiene to

431
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,680
prevent the spread of malware and protect your

432
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
digital wellbeing.

433
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,300
I like that.

434
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,940
Cyber hygiene.

435
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,200
Yeah.

436
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,360
Yeah.

437
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,640
Okay.

438
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,640
So what are some cyber hygiene tips?

439
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,080
Well, one of the most important is using

440
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,360
strong passwords.

441
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,080
Okay.

442
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,660
I know we touched on this earlier, but

443
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,820
it really is worth repeating.

444
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,300
Yeah.

445
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,840
Weak passwords or like leaving your front door

446
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,400
unlocked.

447
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,000
Especially because hackers have tools now that can

448
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
try thousands of passwords per second.

449
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,060
Exactly.

450
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,400
Yeah.

451
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,420
They have these automated tools that can just

452
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,760
brute force their way in.

453
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,440
So yeah, password one, two, three, probably not

454
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,940
going to cut it.

455
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,280
No, not going to cut it.

456
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,320
What should we be doing instead?

457
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,400
So you want to aim for a passphrase

458
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,240
that's at least 12 characters long.

459
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,120
With a mix of upper and lowercase letters,

460
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,840
numbers, and symbols.

461
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,540
Okay.

462
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,420
And ideally you should use a different password

463
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,640
for each of your accounts.

464
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,400
I know.

465
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,420
It's hard to remember all that.

466
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,820
It is.

467
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,920
Which is why I highly recommend using a

468
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,840
password manager.

469
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,080
Right.

470
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,340
Right.

471
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,060
So you can have those super strong passwords

472
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,520
and not have to remember them all.

473
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,160
Exactly.

474
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:20,840
Okay.

475
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,120
Good.

476
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,980
What other cyber hygiene tips do you have?

477
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,380
Another important one is to be very wary

478
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,560
of phishing emails.

479
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,960
Oh, yes.

480
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,540
Those...

481
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,660
Yeah.

482
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
These are emails that try to trick you

483
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,460
into revealing sensitive information.

484
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:32,860
Right.

485
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
Like your passwords or credit card details.

486
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,780
And they can be so convincing.

487
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,600
They can be incredibly convincing.

488
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,320
So it's really important to know how to

489
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,000
spot them.

490
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,760
So what are some things that we can

491
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,620
look out for?

492
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,340
Well, first, always check the sender's email address

493
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,980
very carefully.

494
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,460
Okay.

495
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,400
Does it actually match the company or organization

496
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,700
it claims to be from?

497
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,060
Wow.

498
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
Look for any misspellings or slight variations in

499
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,160
the domain name.

500
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,420
So like amazon.com versus arnazon.com.

501
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,100
Exactly.

502
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,580
Yeah.

503
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,380
Even one letter off could be a sign

504
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,480
that it's a phishing attempt.

505
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,080
Wow.

506
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:04,460
Yeah.

507
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Another red flag is a sense of urgency

508
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,380
or pressure.

509
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:07,920
Okay.

510
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,040
Phishing emails often try to create a sense

511
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,540
of panic so that you'll act without thinking.

512
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,340
Oh, for sure.

513
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,400
So they might say something like, your account

514
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,160
has been compromised.

515
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,920
Click here immediately to reset your password.

516
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,200
Right.

517
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,080
Or, you've won a prize.

518
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,100
Claim it now before it expires.

519
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,380
I always get those.

520
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:25,640
Right.

521
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,120
Exactly.

522
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,560
So if it makes my heart rate go

523
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:27,840
up?

524
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah.

525
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,560
If it makes me feel anxious or pressured,

526
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,300
take a step back and scrutinize it very

527
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,640
carefully.

528
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,220
Good advice.

529
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,660
What else?

530
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,080
Be suspicious of unexpected attachments.

531
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,700
Okay.

532
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
If you receive an attachment from someone you

533
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,540
don't know or if the attachment seems out

534
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,740
of place, don't open it.

535
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,140
Okay.

536
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,540
It could contain malware that could infect your

537
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,000
device.

538
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,800
Don't click it.

539
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,260
Don't click it.

540
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:48,560
Okay.

541
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,880
Got it.

542
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,020
And if you're ever unsure about an email,

543
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,500
it's always best to err on the side

544
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,720
of caution and contact the sender directly to

545
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,780
confirm its legitimacy.

546
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,880
So really it's just about being cautious and

547
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,060
not clicking on things without thinking them through

548
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,520
first.

549
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,240
Exactly.

550
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah.

551
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,340
Good.

552
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,700
Okay.

553
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,760
So cyber hygiene is about building those healthy

554
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,820
digital habits to protect us from common threats.

555
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,460
That's right.

556
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,640
But cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, right?

557
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,260
Absolutely.

558
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,060
It's not just up to the IT department

559
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,320
or the security team.

560
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Right.

561
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,900
Everyone has a role to play.

562
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,360
Our document really stresses the importance of employees

563
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,280
as the first line of defense.

564
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:27,940
They are.

565
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,480
Absolutely.

566
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,900
So what does that mean in practice?

567
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,480
Well, it means that employees are often the

568
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,980
first point of contact for cyber criminals.

569
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Okay.

570
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:35,980
Right.

571
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,120
They might be targeted with phishing emails, social

572
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,420
engineering attempts, or other attacks that aim to

573
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,020
exploit human vulnerabilities.

574
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,260
So even with all the technology in the

575
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,980
world, one employee mistake could really mess things

576
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,460
up.

577
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,060
That's the unfortunate reality, but it's not about

578
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,220
blaming employees.

579
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,680
It's about empowering them to make informed decisions

580
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,980
and take steps to protect themselves and the

581
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,600
organization.

582
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,100
So beyond those strong passwords and not clicking

583
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,480
on phishing links, what else can employees do

584
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,280
to be a good first line of defense?

585
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,060
Well, one important practice is to keep their

586
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,820
devices and software up to date.

587
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,260
Okay.

588
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,480
We talked about this earlier in the context

589
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,840
of endpoint security, but it's worth repeating.

590
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,260
Right.

591
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,300
Those software updates often include security patches that

592
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,600
fix known vulnerabilities.

593
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,360
So like a fresh coat of armor.

594
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,180
Exactly.

595
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,560
Yeah.

596
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,360
It's like constantly upgrading your defenses to protect

597
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,600
against the latest threats.

598
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

599
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,340
Good.

600
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,060
Another important habit is to be mindful of

601
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,420
what information they share online, both personally and

602
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,880
professionally.

603
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,360
So like social media, that kind of thing.

604
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:37,660
Yeah.

605
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,380
Social media, public websites, avoid sharing sensitive information

606
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,340
on those platforms.

607
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,700
Right.

608
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,160
And be cautious about what links you click

609
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,960
on or what websites you visit.

610
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,280
Okay.

611
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,040
So be aware of your digital footprint.

612
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Exactly.

613
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,480
Think before you click.

614
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,640
Think before you click.

615
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
Think before you post.

616
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,740
Good advice.

617
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,260
And if an employee does encounter a potential

618
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,280
security incident, it's crucial that they report it

619
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
immediately to the appropriate personnel.

620
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,140
Makes sense.

621
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,660
The sooner you catch it, the less damage

622
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,220
it can do.

623
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,300
Exactly.

624
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:07,660
Yeah.

625
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,380
Early detection and response are key.

626
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,280
So all of this really highlights how important

627
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,860
it is to create a culture of cybersecurity

628
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,600
within the organization.

629
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,460
It's not just about having rules and policies.

630
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,380
It's about really building that environment where security

631
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,600
is everyone's priority.

632
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,360
It's about fostering a culture where employees feel

633
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,400
comfortable reporting potential security issues, where they're encouraged

634
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,980
to learn about cybersecurity, and where they feel

635
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,920
empowered to take ownership of their digital security.

636
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,260
Right.

637
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,000
So it sounds like building that culture is

638
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,760
really crucial.

639
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,480
It is.

640
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,100
It is.

641
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,320
Okay.

642
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,620
So we're going to take a quick pause

643
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,740
here, and then when we come back, we'll

644
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,480
delve a little bit deeper into the role

645
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,160
of leadership in creating this culture of cybersecurity.

646
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,240
Okay.

647
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,860
So we've talked a lot about what individuals

648
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,100
can do, but now let's zoom out and

649
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,340
look at the bigger picture, the organization as

650
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,720
a whole.

651
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,080
Right.

652
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,120
And I'm really curious about the role of

653
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,180
leadership in all of this.

654
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,319
Leadership is absolutely critical in building a strong

655
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,619
cybersecurity culture.

656
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,500
Why is that?

657
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,400
Well, because leaders set the tone for the

658
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,500
entire organization.

659
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,579
So if they make it clear that cybersecurity

660
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,599
is important, everyone else is more likely to

661
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,359
take it seriously.

662
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:15,980
Exactly.

663
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,339
Yeah.

664
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,839
If leaders are actively involved in cybersecurity initiatives,

665
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,880
if they participate in training, if they follow

666
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,240
best practices themselves, it sends a really powerful

667
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,980
message to the rest of the team.

668
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,200
So lead by example.

669
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,720
Absolutely.

670
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,260
Yeah.

671
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,620
Okay.

672
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,800
So what are some concrete steps that leaders

673
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,900
can take to actually foster this culture of

674
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,340
cybersecurity?

675
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,980
Well, one of the most important is to

676
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,340
establish clear cybersecurity policies and procedures.

677
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,240
So like a rule book for the digital

678
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,560
world?

679
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah, exactly.

680
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,200
Like a rule book, a set of guidelines

681
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,640
that everyone needs to follow.

682
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,560
So what kind of things should these policies

683
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:51,880
cover?

684
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,780
Well, they should outline expectations for things like

685
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,120
password management, data handling, social media use, incident

686
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,340
reporting, all the key aspects of cybersecurity.

687
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,800
But just having those policies written down isn't

688
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,440
enough, right?

689
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,480
No, not at all.

690
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,620
People need to know about them.

691
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:08,820
Right.

692
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Communication is key.

693
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,320
Leaders need to effectively communicate these policies to

694
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,940
their employees.

695
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,700
Provide regular training and awareness sessions.

696
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,520
Make sure that everyone understands their role in

697
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,640
maintaining security.

698
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,340
So make sure everyone's on the same page.

699
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Exactly.

700
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah.

701
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,640
And it's not a one-time thing either,

702
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:25,880
right?

703
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
No, it's an ongoing process.

704
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
Because things are constantly changing.

705
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,540
Exactly.

706
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,080
The threats are constantly evolving.

707
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,820
So ongoing education and communication are essential.

708
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,280
So regular refreshers, updates, that kind of thing.

709
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,760
Absolutely.

710
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,920
Now, what about the technology side of things?

711
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,020
What role does leadership play there?

712
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,320
Well, leaders need to make sure that the

713
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,720
organization is investing in appropriate security technologies.

714
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,400
Like firewalls and antivirus software.

715
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,020
Yes.

716
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,060
Those are definitely important, but it goes beyond

717
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,720
that as well.

718
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:52,920
Okay.

719
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,340
Things like intrusion detection systems, data loss prevention

720
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,480
tools, security information, and event management systems.

721
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,540
Those sound pretty complex.

722
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,460
They can be, yeah.

723
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
But the good news is that there are

724
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
a lot of great vendors out there who

725
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,280
can help SMEs implement and manage these technologies.

726
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,260
So you don't necessarily need to have a

727
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,060
huge IT department to be able to handle

728
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,320
this?

729
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,980
No, not at all.

730
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,540
Okay, good.

731
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
And the specific technologies that an organization needs

732
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,260
will vary depending on their size, their industry,

733
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,140
the types of data they handle.

734
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,440
So it's about finding the right solutions for

735
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
each individual organization.

736
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,420
Exactly.

737
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:28,940
Okay.

738
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,380
And I imagine that having a dedicated IT

739
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,640
team or even a cybersecurity expert can make

740
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,460
a big difference.

741
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,040
It can, especially for smaller businesses that might

742
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,920
not have the resources to handle everything in

743
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,360
-house.

744
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:42,980
Right.

745
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,440
Having someone who can proactively manage security risks,

746
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,300
implement the appropriate controls, and respond effectively to

747
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,500
incidents can be invaluable.

748
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,700
It sounds like building a strong cybersecurity posture

749
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,320
is a multifaceted effort.

750
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:57,880
It is.

751
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,260
It is.

752
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,220
It involves leadership, policies, training, technology, expertise.

753
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,860
All of those things working together.

754
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,380
But ultimately it comes down to creating that

755
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,960
culture where cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility.

756
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,780
Absolutely.

757
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,720
That's the key takeaway.

758
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,340
We've learned so much about the importance of

759
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,080
cybersecurity, the key components, the role of employees,

760
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,100
the crucial role of leadership.

761
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,120
And hopefully our listener feels empowered to take

762
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,820
what they've learned and apply it to their

763
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,700
own organization.

764
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
So to our listener, remember that cybersecurity is

765
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,740
an ongoing journey.

766
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,920
It is.

767
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,980
It's not a destination.

768
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,660
Not at all.

769
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,240
Stay informed, stay vigilant, never stop learning.

770
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,580
And don't be afraid to ask questions and

771
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,180
seek guidance.

772
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
There are lots of resources available to help

773
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,600
you on your cybersecurity journey.

774
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,680
That's great advice.

775
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,540
